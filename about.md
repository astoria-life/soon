# Join The Parallel Food Economy

---

We believe that each of us has the God given right to produce, sell, buy, and consume traditional nutrient dense food. Astoria is an Online Food Church: A private member to member marketplace for healthy food focused on building local networks. Astoria enables members to cultivate relationships with food producers near and far, and easily become a food producer themself.

# Why

---

## 1. Give People Convenient Access to Local Food and Create Local Networks

When people know their food producers personally, the entire society is more resilient.

## 2. Promote Regenerative Food Production

Provide education, reference, and training to help people produce food regeneratively.

## 3. Promote Food Production for more People at Any Scale

Give food producers an easy online presence.

Lower the barrier for entry to produce food (ex: bypass certifications)

## 4. Allow Access to Foods that can’t be Sold Publicly

Food producers should be able to process their own animals, sell unwashed eggs, raw milk, etc.


# How

---

Numbers in parentheses denote which "why" they solve.

## Multi-Vendor Ecommerce Marketplace (3)
Astoria runs a web application which in many ways is similar to Etsy. Vendors create accounts and sell food, and customers create accounts and buy food. Vendors don’t need to know how to build/host a web storefront, but still have access to internet sales. The “network effect” comes into play when Vendors join the platform because people are already using it and searching for food. This gives Vendors access to a market.

## Food Church (3, 4)
Astoria is an Unincorporated Entity, also known as a Private Membership Association. Vendors and Customers must join the private organization in order to use the platform. This means they are trading within a private organization and not in the public space, which bypasses many federal regulations around food production, ownership, and trade. This allows for the sale of raw milk, animals which have been processed without processing permits, unwashed eggs, etc.

## Community Pickups (1)
On the marketplace platform, Vendors can create or join Community Pickups, which determine exactly where and when food delivery/transfer will occur. Many Vendors join the same Community Pickup and all come to a location (ex: parking lot) at the same time (ex: weekly on Saturdays at noon). Customers come to this location and pick up their order from one or more Vendors. This makes the process of buying a variety of foods much more convenient. The Vendors get more benefit than a farmers market as well because they are going to the location for a shorter duration of time and the food is already purchased.

## Education (2)
Astoria compiles and produces informational content to teach people the principles of regenerative food production. Examples of content could include courses, videos, articles, etc. There is also a large section linking users to other resources like books and documentaries.

## Quality Tiers (2)
Astoria rates Vendors within a system based on regenerative food production principles, somewhat similarly to Whole Foods. Vendors go through an application process to join the platform and start at the base tier. In order to reach higher tiers, an Astoria representative must inspect the facility and determine the rating. Higher tiers give more perks such as lower transaction fees and higher customer reach through content boosting.

# Value Proposition

## Challenges

### Food Producers (Vendors)

#### Middlemen
The many middlemen present in the current landscape make it difficult for Vendors to get adequate prices for their food. Instead, we should adopt a Direct-to-Consumer approach by creating an online ecommerce marketplace. This eliminates middlemen from the market so that Vendors can interact directly with consumers and sell their food at reasonable prices.

#### Supply Chain
Similar to the Middlemen challenge, the current supply chain is very large and fragile. Food may never end up on the shelves of some far away grocery store. Focusing on expanding a Vendors presence in their local community is an effective solution.

#### Regulations
In the absence of customers knowing their food producer, regulations help ease the trust gap. But, with a direct to consumer model, customers know their food producer and are more likely to purchase food even if the producer hasn’t acquired certain certifications such as Organic.

#### Finding Customers
Many food producers are having a hard time growing their customer base and expanding their production. Selling to grocery stores has the above problems, marketing on their own is difficult and potentially expensive, and word of mouth may not be returning the results they need. An online network of food producers expands their reach easily and effectively.

### Customers

#### Empty grocery store shelves
Supply chain issues are showing the fragility of depending on food shipped thousands of miles.

#### Lack of high quality food in grocery stores
Grocery stores can not sell eggs unless they've been chlorinated, raw milk, etc.

#### Sourcing and orchestrating logistics of buying directly from multiple producers
In order to buy high quality foods directly from food producers, customers must source their needed food from several different producers independently, a large logistical effort.

## Solution
### The Astoria Food Church Multi-Vendor Ecommerce Marketplace

Meet in the middle between the Grocery Store, where customers pay for the luxury of not having to source all the products individually, and buying directly from vendors, which is cheaper, but requires coordination.

The marketplace gives the luxury of easily sourcing all needed food, just like a grocery store, with much closer to direct from producer prices.

## Benefits

### Food Producers

#### Reach More Customers
Vendors are essentially required to have a significant online presence to capture a large audience.

#### Enhanced Marketing
Vendors can effectively market their food with an online platform. They can promote their food with ad campaigns in the marketplace, and then email marketing to their growing customer base. They can quickly reach their target audience, get actionable leads, and build a solid brand presence.

#### Reduced Expenses
For producers that are used to selling to grocery stores, at farmers markets, or through their own ecommerce website, they will notice the cost to do business drop. By not selling food to grocery stores at a marked down price, hiring a seller to manage and run the often hectic farmers market circuit schedule, or pay a third party to host and maintain their ecommerce platform, producers will make greater profit with less overall work.

### Customers

#### Consume Local Food not dependent on Supply Chains

Buying food locally increases the likelihood that products will be in stock, and creates a more connected community.

#### Easy Access to High Quality Food

Astoria allows people to freely trade high quality food.

#### Convenient Sourcing from Multiple Food Producers

Lower prices than the grocery store, but the convenience of easily buying from multiple Vendors.


# Revenue Model

---

Commission on Each Transaction

This is an excellent model because food producers don’t pay anything to set up a shop or list products, and only get a small cut taken out when they make sales.

The payment processor takes about 2% and Astoria takes about 7% total. 3% of that is added on to the sub-total and paid by the customer, and 4% is paid by the vendor. The Vendor only has to pay 6% of their revenue to the platform, which provides far more value than that small investment.


# Food Transfer Options

---

The platform allows a community to orchestrate pickups for the community that multiple Vendors will all service.

Any of the following options are opt in by a Vendor, and selectable by a customer based on the options provided by the Vendor.

## Community Pickup (Recommended)
The Vendor sets pickup locations and times and delivers orders in a batch to these Community Pickups. For example, every week a Vendor drives to a couple nearby town centers to deliver all the orders placed that week.
In the marketplace, a Vendor adds or joins Community Pickups. These are searchable on the map. Other Vendors are encouraged to make use of existing Community Pickups as well. This allows customers to make orders from multiple Vendors and pick them all up at the same time in the same place.

## Delivery Service
A Vendor can use a Third Party Delivery Service (ex: Fedex, USPS).

## On Premise Pickup
A customer can go to the Vendor’s location and acquire their order.

## Direct Delivery
A Vendor can deliver orders directly to customers.


# User Experience

---

The marketplace is Community Pickup focused. Default functionality and user experience is centered around Community Pickups.

## Customer

#### Community Pickup Search
Customers log in, enter their location, and then search. This produces a map with the Community Pickups in their area. When they select a pickup, they get a storefront that combines all of the Vendors that service that pickup.
Customers add products to their cart, checkout, and then the orders are split and routed to the appropriate Vendor. At the pickup, the customer is notified of the Vendors that have a piece of their order.

#### Vendor Search
Users can search for Vendors. This can bring them to the page for a Vendor, where they can see their 'about' section and all their products.

#### Food Search
Users can search for food. This returns results on all the food on Astoria, which can be filtered by location.

#### Checkout
In checkout, users can select the shipping methods for each Vendor. If coming from shopping a Community Pickup, that pickup is the default value. Users can change this shipping method though.

## Vendor
A Vendor joins the platform after filling out an application process requiring pictures of their operation, a description of their processes, and more. After approval, they add details to their Vendor ‘about’ page, add products and stock, join or add new Community Pickups, and set themselves to open for business. They can, at any time, receive orders for their products that are listed and have stock.

Vendors can see all the orders that are part of a Community Pickup easily.

Vendors get lower transaction fees if they use Community Pickups.


# Memes

Astoria believes the following ideas:

Regenerative Food Production will save us.

Processed Food like substances are poison. They destroy us, animals, plants, and the whole ecosystem.

High Quality Food is the foundation of health.

Shipping food far creates a fragile system.

Interdependent communities which produce the majority of their own food are necessary.

The current conventional food production practices are destroying our health, the health of all life, and the health of the Earth.

Building a healthy Earth means adopting practices that promote health for people, all other life, and the Earth.

Regenerative farming utilizes practices such as no-till, rotational grazing, and no synthetic pesticides or fertilizers.

Preservation of ancestral wisdom and traditional practices leads to sustainability and overall health at all levels.

Healing the Earth requires humans, plants, animals, and microorganisms working together.

Ruminant and pollinating animals play a critical role in all life cycles and systems.

High quality animal products heal our bodies and the Earth.

Eating nose-to-tail is necessary for our health and the sustainability of our existence.

Waste must be minimized, and using the whole animal is one path on that journey.

Taking part in the natural cycles of life lead to sustainability and less waste. Composting allows these cycles to happen. Feeding leftover food to chickens minimizes waste.

We have the technology to grow anything anywhere. We need to capitalize on this.

We must lower the bar for entry to produce food and distribute it to the community.

Everyone should be producing at least some food.

Distributing food among your community should require no upfront cost and very little technical knowledge or effort.

Communities need a system to organize trade of local food.

People need easy access to information regarding healthy food production and preparation.
