# How

---

Numbers in parentheses denote which "why" they solve.

## Multi-Vendor Ecommerce Marketplace (3)
Astoria runs a web application which in many ways is similar to Etsy. Vendors create accounts and sell food, and customers create accounts and buy food. Vendors don’t need to know how to build/host a web storefront, but still have access to internet sales. The “network effect” comes into play when vendors join the platform because people are already using it and searching for food. This gives vendors access to a market.

## Food Church (3, 4)
Astoria is a 508c legal organization making is fall under the “Religious” organization category. Vendors and Customers must join the private organization in order to use the platform. This means they are trading within a private organization and not in the public space, which bypasses many federal regulations around food production, ownership, and trade. This allows for the sale of raw milk, animals which have been processed without processing permits, unwashed eggs, etc.

## Community Pickups (1)
On the marketplace platform, vendors can create or join Community Pickups, which determine exactly where and when food delivery/transfer will occur. Many vendors join the same community pickup and all come to a location (ex: parking lot) at the same time (ex: weekly on Saturdays at noon). Customers come to this location and pick up their order from one or more vendors. This makes the process of buying a variety of foods much more convenient. The vendors get more benefit than a farmers market as well because they are going to the location for a shorter duration of time and the food is already purchased.

## Education (2)
Astoria compiles and produces informational content to teach people the principles of regenerative food production. Examples of content could include courses, videos, articles, etc. There is also a large section linking users to other resources like books and documentaries.

## Quality Tiers (2)
Astoria rates vendors within a system based on regenerative food production principles, somewhat similarly to Whole Foods. Vendors go through an application process to join the platform and start at the base tier. In order to reach higher tiers, an Astoria representative must inspect the facility and determine the rating. Higher tiers give more perks such as lower transaction fees and higher customer reach through content boosting.


# Value Proposition

## Challenges

### Food Producers

#### Middlemen
The many middlemen present in the current landscape make it difficult for farmers to get adequate prices for their food. Instead, we should adopt a Direct-to-Consumer approach by creating an online ecommerce marketplace. This eliminates middlemen from the market so that farmers can interact directly with consumers and sell their food at reasonable prices.

#### Supply Chain
Similar to the Middlemen challenge, the current supply chain is very large and fragile. Food may never end up on the shelves of some far away grocery store. Focusing on expanding a farmers presence in their local community is an effective solution.

#### Regulations
In the absence of customers knowing their farmer, regulations help ease the trust gap. But, with a direct to consumer model, customers know their food producer and are more likely to purchase food even if the producer hasn’t acquired certain certifications such as Organic.

#### Finding Customers
Many food producers are having a hard time growing their customer base and expanding their production. Selling to grocery stores has the above problems, marketing on their own is difficult and potentially expensive, and word of mouth may not be returning the results they need. An online network of food producers expands their reach easily an effectively.

### Customers

#### Empty grocery store shelves
Supply chain issues are showing the fragility of depending on food shipped thousands of miles

#### Lack of high quality food in grocery stores
Grocery stores can not sell eggs unless they've been chlorinated, raw milk, etc.

#### Sourcing and orchestrating logistics of buying directly from multiple producers
In order to buy high quality foods directly from food producers, customers must source their needed food from several different producers independently, a large logistical effort.

## Solution
The Astoria Food Church Multi-Vendor Ecommerce Marketplace

Meet in the middle between the Grocery Store, where customers pay for the luxury of not having to source all the products individually, and sourcing all the products individually and managing the logistics, which is cheaper, but requires coordination.

The marketplace gives the luxury of easily sourcing all needed food, just like a grocery store, with much closer to direct from producer prices.

## Benefits

### Food Producers

#### Reach More Customers
Farmers are essentially required to have a significant online presence to capture a large audience.

#### Enhanced Marketing
Farmers can effectively market their food with an online platform. They can promote their food with ad campaigns in the marketplace, and then email marketing to their growing customer base. They can quickly reach their target audience, get actionable leads, and build a solid brand presence.

#### Reduced Expenses
For producers that are used to selling to grocery stores, at farmers markets, or through their own ecommerce website, they will notice the cost to do business drop. By not selling food to grocery stores at a marked down price, hiring a seller to manage and run the often hectic farmers market circuit schedule, or pay a third party to host and maintain their ecommerce platform, producers will make greater profit with less overall work.

### Customers

#### Consume Local Food not dependent on Supply Chains  

#### Easy Access to High Quality Food

#### Convenient Sourcing from Multiple Food Producers

# Revenue

---

## Model
Commission on Each Transaction

## Potential Revenue
Commission per transaction is an excellent model because food producers don’t pay anything to set up a shop or list products, and only get a small cut taken out when they make sales. If the payment processor takes about 2% and we take 3%, then the farmer only has to pay 5% of their revenue to the platform, which provides far more value than that small investment.

# Food Transfer Options

---

The main difference and value add for the platform is to orchestrate pickups for the community that multiple vendors in the area will all service.

Any of the following options are opt in by a vendor, and selectable by a customer based on the options provided by the vendor.

## Community Pickup (Recommended)
The vendor sets pickup locations and times and delivers orders in a batch to these locations. For example, every week a vendor drives to a couple nearby town centers to deliver all the orders placed that week.
In the marketplace, a vendor enters their pickup location(s). This becomes a searchable entity on the map. Other vendors are encouraged to make use of that pickup location and time, if possible, as well. This allows customers to make orders from multiple vendors and pickup them all up at the same time in the same place.

Vendors can select a price for their servicing of a particular pickup.

## Not Recommended

### Delivery Service
A vendor can use a Third Party Delivery Service (ex: Fedex, USPS).

### On Premise Pickup
A customer can go to the vendor’s location and acquire their order.

### Direct Delivery
A vendor can deliver orders directly to customers.
